I will make a Ball Bounce prediction game.

The program will consist of a window that has balls bouncing around
the screen with the user predicting the location of the red ball 
after 5 seconds with every correct prediction (with a bit of leway)
will increase the number of balls and every incorrect prediction will
decrease the number of balls.
